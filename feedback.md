* really useful thank you! Nothing specific byt I like seeing what you can do with data - like a much better version of excel
* really good tool and we covered a lot at a good pace - also very clear how this can be used day to day
* finding jounral title by ISSN was very helpful
* important tool introduction
* Openrefine tool really great. Knowledgeable instructor
* Lots of different examples shown, lots of different functions demonstrated

###The Bad
* images on screen somtimes not big enough
* just my eyesight and the fire alarm test
* a bit too fast for dinosaurs
* sometimes hard to see computer screen so more of a slight issue with the room
* small screen/room set up not ideal but it wasnt too big of a stumbling block
* the preed of the presentations, covered too much. stops after each step are required - ?? for helpers to help not sufficient
* too fast when running through examples
* maybe slightly fast session
* nothing to add- really well balanced intro
* would prefer a web-based workshop (remote session) v "classroom"
